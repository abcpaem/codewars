# Codewars (Just for Fun)
This is my gallery for Codewars challenges. This repository contains extracts of code in different languages for educational purposes.

### Goal
Sometimes we are stuck thinking and thinking how to solve something in particular and we end up going nowhere and discouraged.

The purpose of these code extracts is to give other developers some ideas in how to solve certain challenges.

### Important Notes
If you are learning how to code, just copying a whole solution from others is not going to help you learn, but there is no harm in analysing others code for learning purposes.

### Split Strings

Split an input string into pairs of 2 characters, add underscore if the last letter is single.

**Language:** Java

**Example:**
```
"mine"  ->  ["mi", "ne"]
"yours" ->  ["yo", "ur", "s_"]
```
